# U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators dataset from the CDC. The analysis investigates trends, geographic variations, and topic-based differences in chronic disease prevalence.

## Dataset Source
- **Dataset:** U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators
- **Source URL:** [CDC Data Portal](https://data.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators/hksd-2xuw/about_data)
- **Description:** The dataset contains key chronic disease metrics, risk factors, and stratifications across U.S. locations.

## Methodology
The analysis followed these main steps:
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:**  
   - Imported the CSV file using Pandas.
   - Standardized column names, handled missing values, and transformed data where needed.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Generated summary statistics.
   - Visualized the data distribution using histograms, bar charts, and line charts (using Matplotlib).
3. **Analysis of Business Questions:**  
   - Compared state-level differences in chronic disease prevalence.
   - Analyzed time trends by converting year columns to datetime.
   - Explored topic-based variations in the chronic disease indicators.

## Key Insights
- Certain states display higher average chronic disease prevalence.
- National trends over time reveal [mention specific trends observed].
- Analysis by topic showed significant variations, indicating potential focus areas for public health interventions.
