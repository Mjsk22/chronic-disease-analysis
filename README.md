        "## Overview\n",
        "This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators dataset from the CDC. The analysis investigates trends, geographic variations, and topic-based differences in chronic disease prevalence.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Source\n",
        "- **Dataset:** U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators\n",
        "- **Source URL:** [CDC Data Portal](https://data.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators/hksd-2xuw/about_data)\n",
        "- **Description:** The dataset contains key chronic disease metrics, risk factors, and stratifications across U.S. locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "The analysis followed these main steps:\n",
        "1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:**  \n",
        "   - Imported the CSV file using Pandas.\n",
        "   - Standardized column names, handled missing values, and transformed data where needed.\n",
        "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  \n",
        "   - Generated summary statistics.\n",
        "   - Visualized the data distribution using histograms, bar charts, and line charts (using Matplotlib).\n",
        "3. **Analysis of Business Questions:**  \n",
        "   - Compared state-level differences in chronic disease prevalence.\n",
        "   - Analyzed time trends by converting year columns to datetime.\n",
        "   - Explored topic-based variations in the chronic disease indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Insights\n",
        "- Certain states display higher average chronic disease prevalence.\n",
        "- National trends over time reveal [mention specific trends observed].\n",
        "- Analysis by topic showed significant variations, indicating potential focus areas for public health interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Run the Analysis\n",
        "1. Clone the repository.\n",
        "2. Install the required packages:\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   pip install -r requirements.txt\n"
